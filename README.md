# DSystems

Using Django to create dynamic system.
For the future, essential mechanics of project will be extracted and put into
an app of its own. For potential use of community.

As of the state of the project right now, it's a mixture between a django
app, and specific functionality I want abstracted out.


TODO 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
* In the future, move db management to a more dynamic one instead of just
  plopping in into one sqlite table, with use of filtering mechanics. What
  could be done is creating a Manager method for Schema, that handles
  either Table creation or DB creation.
